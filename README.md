# CS-wk4
Dear All,
 
Your prep will only be due after half-term because of all the lessons you will be missing. Below is a program that I have written (similar to today’s program). Please answer the questions that follow in your book or in a Word document (or otherwise):
 
What does the program do?
What does “len(word)” calculate?
Work out the output for the following inputs:
Hello there.
You were the chosen one!
It’s outrageous! It’s unfair!
EXTENSION: I have attached the program for you to modify.
Get the program to replace any exclamation mark with a smiley :)
Get the program to replace any identical adjacent letters with a ‘2’
·   Eg: INPUT -> “Look, a matter of perspective!”,   OUTPUT -> “L22K, 4 m4223r 0f p3rsp3ct1v3”
SUPER EXTENSION:
Write a new program that shuffles all the letters of each word EXCEPT for the first and last letter.
·   Eg: INPUT -> “Great balls of fire!”    OUTPUT -> “Gaert blals of frie”
 
Have fun and have an excellent Battlefields trip!
 
Best Wishes,
 
Mr Boshoff
